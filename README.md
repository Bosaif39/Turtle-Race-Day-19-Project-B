# **Turtle Race**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 19 project B from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. In this project, you'll create a fun turtle race simulation using Python's `turtle` module. The user bets on which turtle will win the race, and the program runs the race to determine the winner.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Setup:**
   - The screen is initialized and set up with a specified width and height.
   - The user is prompted to place a bet on which turtle they think will win by entering a color.

2. **Turtle Initialization:**
   - Six turtles, each with a unique color, are created and positioned at the starting line.
   - Turtles are placed in different vertical positions to ensure they start in distinct lanes.

3. **Race Execution:**
   - The race begins if the user has placed a bet.
   - Turtles move forward by a random distance on each iteration until one crosses the finish line.
   - The race concludes when a turtle crosses the finish line, and the result is compared to the user's bet to determine if they won or lost.

4. **Results:**
   - The color of the winning turtle is displayed along with a message indicating whether the user's bet was correct.

5. **Exit:**
   - The program waits for a click on the screen to exit.
